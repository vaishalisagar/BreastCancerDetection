# BreastCancerDetection using Machine Learning Model and application deployment 

Background

Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. It can start in one or both breasts. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.**Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.** Each year in the United States, about 264,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women and about 2,400 in men. About 42,000 women and 500 men in the U.S. die each year from breast cancer.

Importance of the Analysis

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women.**The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about 1 in 39**. The map below shows the impact of breast cancer gloablly.
